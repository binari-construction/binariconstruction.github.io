Every homeowner wants to feel safe and secure in their home. A crucial aspect of this security lies in the structural integrity of the building - a term that often gets mentioned but is not always fully understood. In this detailed guide, part of our series on home maintenance, we will explore what structural integrity means, why it's vital, and how to assess it in your home.

<strong>Understanding Structural Integrity</strong>
<p>At its core, structural integrity is about a building's ability to endure. It means that the structure can bear not only its weight but also the weight of the occupants, furniture, and any external forces like wind or snow. It is the fundamental aspect that ensures your home remains standing and safe over the years.</p>

Why Structural Integrity Matters
The consequences of compromised structural integrity can range from minor inconveniences to catastrophic failures. A small crack in a non-load-bearing wall might not pose an immediate threat, but significant issues in load-bearing beams or foundations can lead to severe damage or even collapse. Regular assessment and maintenance of structural integrity are key to preventing such outcomes.

How to Identify Structural Issues
Homeowners should be vigilant for signs of structural weakness. These can include:

Cracks or unevenness in walls, beams, and columns.
Misalignment of walls, such as leaning or bowing.
Settlement or sinking of the foundation.
Doors or windows that become difficult to open or close, indicating shifting structures.
Common Structural Problems
Structural issues can manifest in various forms, depending on the age and construction of the building. Older homes might face problems due to settling over time, while newer constructions might suffer from poor building practices. Environmental factors, such as soil type and climate, also play a significant role.

Preventative Measures and Solutions
Regular inspections are crucial. This involves checking for visible signs of damage and employing professionals for a thorough assessment. Early detection allows for simpler, more cost-effective solutions. Repair strategies might include underpinning a weakened foundation, reinforcing damaged beams, or fixing alignment issues.

The company was previously known as Hingston + Co. but has been given a complete rebrand — including a new logo, tap badges, website and branded material — by London-based design studio & Smith. The new identity is based on the Kandinsky abstract painting, Black Lines, and true to its name, is mostly black and white with a few flashes of colour. According to & Smith, the identity brings together “art and science” and has been brought to life through collaborations with nine illustrators.

Black Lines wants it to be as easy to serve a Negroni as it is a pint of lager. The drinks company is seeking to revolutionise the bar experience by serving cocktails by draught with a changing menu of drinks (as well as same favourite stand-bys). A pink grapefruit spritz was served through the summer while a new pear and white tea fizz joins the line-up for winter.
